Caesar
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
Scytale
Suppose the rod allows one to write four letters around in a circle and five letters down the side of it. The plaintext could be: "Help me I am under attack".
To encrypt, one simply writes across the leather:
